# ChatApp-Settings-
A basic chat app with only settings page functionality. The aim is to create a settings page using Android Prefences library in Kotlin
The chat part of the app does not do anything, but the main purpose was to create a settings page similar to that of various chat apps likle WhatsApp using Android Preferences library. Creating settings pages is a integral part of app development so as to give users a custom experience to your app according to their preferences. Android has a custom settings library that makes this easier and this was done using that under the Google Africa Developer Scholarship 2021 with Pluralsight.

From the images of the app shown, the settings page of the app allows for users to set a status message, toggle whether they would like to give auto-replies within a specific time that the user will choose. Also allows for deletion of the user's account and gives the apps version info and policies as well. The ploicy button will take you to the relevant page online using the default browser on the user's phone.
